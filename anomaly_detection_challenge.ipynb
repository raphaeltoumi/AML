    "Anomaly detection (AD) refers to the process of detecting data points that do not conform with the rest of observations. Applications of anomaly detection include fraud and fault detection, surveillance, diagnosis, data cleanup, predictive maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about AD, we usually look at it as an unsupervised (or semi-supervised) task, where the concept of anomaly is often not well defined or, in the best case, just few samples are labeled as anomalous. In this challenge, you will look at AD from a different perspective!\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you are going to work on consists of monitoring data generated by IT systems; such data is then processed by a monitoring system that executes some checks and detects a series of anomalies. This is a multi-label classification problem, where each check is a binary label corresponding to a specific type of anomaly. Your goal is to develop a machine learning model (or multiple ones) to accurately detect such anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also involve a mixture of data exploration, pre-processing, model selection, and performance evaluation. You will also be asked to try one or more rule learning models, and compare them with other ML models both in terms of predictive performances and interpretability. Interpreatibility is indeed a strong requirement especially in applications like AD where understanding the output of a model is as important as the output itself.\n",
