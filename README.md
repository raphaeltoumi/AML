# Algorithmic-Machine-Learning
This repositories contains notebooks of projects from the Algorithmic Machine Learning course I took at Eurecom in 2019.

Those notebooks required to address several challenges, that can be roughly classified in:

Data preparation and cleaning
Building descriptive statistics of the data
Working on a selected algorithm, e.g., for building a statistical model
Working on experimental validation
